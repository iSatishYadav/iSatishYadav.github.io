title: How am I blogging using Jekyll and GitHub pages from my Android phone
---
Hi, in this post we'll see how to blog from an android phone using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  

I'll try to cut it short and get straight to point. 

Steps:
1. Go to [Jekyll Now][Jekyll Now] and fork it, rename this repo to <your username>.github.io because contents of this repo will automatically hosted by github at <your username>.github.io. Follow their Readme to configure title etc. settings related to your blog. 

2. Now that you're blog is up and running, next step is set up your phone for blogging. Download [Mr. Hyde app][Mr. Hyde App] and setup your login with your github account. 

That's it, now you can blog from your Android phone. 

P. S. I've setup this blog using same steps and I am writing this post using same app.
