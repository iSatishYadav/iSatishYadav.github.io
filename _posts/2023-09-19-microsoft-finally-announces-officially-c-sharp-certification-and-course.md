Microsoft has [announced](https://shawt.io/r/sZx) the official C# certification [Foundational C# with Microsoft](https://shawt.io/r/sZw) in partnership with *FreeCodeCamp* — a popular online learning platform.

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to C# programming, covering its core concepts, syntax, and practical application in software development.

> Through hands-on exercises and projects, you will learn the fundamentals of C#, including variables, data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming principles.

By the end of this course, you will have gained the practical skills and knowledge needed to confidently leverage C# for building applications.

### Is it worth learning C# today?

Well, yes of course! C# continues to be among the World’s top 5 Programming Languages, after Python, C, C++, and Java. Surpassing even JavaScript, Go, and Rust. C# is used not only by Large Enterprises but also in Game Development, Web Development, Cross-Platform Mobile App development and many more.

The certification is completely free.

This new certification’s content is hosted on Microsoft Learn — Microsoft’s learning Platform where hundreds of Microsoft Training and Learning materials are available free of cost.

The official C# certification was missing for a long time as earlier official certification [**Exam 70-483: Programming in C#**](https://shawt.io/r/sZv) had retired in 2021.

### Is it for me?

The course has something for everybody, whether you're a seasoned developer working with C# for decades or a newcomer who is just trying their hands dirty with C#. I too, have completed the Course and got the Certificate and I must say it’s comprehensive. It doesn’t require prior C# knowledge but assumes you have some programming sense.

One small weirdness I have observed is, it requires you to go back and forth between freeCodeCamp and Microsoft Learn to unlock trophies and complete tasks. Everything else is seamless, structured, and to the point.

Here are the complete official steps to complete the certification:

### Steps to earn your certificate

1. Go to the [Foundational C# Certification path on freeCodeCamp](https://shawt.io/r/sZw). Here you’ll find the training content under **Courses**. Press **Expand course** to find all the modules within each course.

4. Once you are done, complete the comprehension check question on freeCodeCamp.
    
5. At the end of each course, you will receive a Trophy on Microsoft Learn. Each step on freeCodeCamp will show instructions for how you can claim and submit these Trophies.
    
6. Once you complete all the training, take the exam.
    
7. Earn your certification!
