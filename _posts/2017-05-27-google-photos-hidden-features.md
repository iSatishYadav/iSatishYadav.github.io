If you're reading this article that means you already know about Google Photos, if not let's see.

### What is Google Photos?

>Google Photos is a **FREE** service by Google which helps you store, share and search your photos on an __unlimited__ online storage aka cloud.

### How to get Google Photos

Google Photos is available as
* App ([iOS][Google Photos iTunes] and [Android][Google Photos Android])
* Web-site [https://photos.google.com][Google Photos]

### Features
#### 1. Unlimited Storage  
Google Photo gives you unlimited storage on cloud for your videos. But in order to use this, you need to upload your photos in "High Quality" instead of "Original Quality".  
##### Now what the heck is this _High Quality_?  
* Photos are compressed to save space. If a photo is larger than 16MP, it will be resized to 16MP.  
* Videos higher than 1080p will be resized to high-definition 1080p. A video with 1080p or less will look close to the original.
##### What about Original quality?
* All photos and videos are stored in the same resolution that you took them.
* Limited free storage that uses storage in your Google Account.
* If you have a Pixel phone, you get free unlimited storage at Original quality. You won’t be able to use “High quality.”

#### 2. Search by Anything
Thius unique and awesome feature lets you search your photos by place, object or occasion.  
E.g. Search _Horse_ and all your photos with horses in it appear; amazing, right?  
And important part is you don't have to tag or categorize or anything special for this.
