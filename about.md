I believe in giving back to the society. When I started as a Full Stack Software Development Engineer around 2014, I used to read lots of blogs, articles, and websites to keep me updated about new technologies and what’s going on in the industry. After a while I felt the urge to give back to society – it was my turn to contribute. I wanted to share my experiences to the world, I wanted to keep the learning torch on – this feeling birthed blog.satishyadav.com.
